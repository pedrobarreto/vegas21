# BlackJack Card Game

Welcome to Vegas21! Blackjack, also known to some as twenty-one, is one of the most popular casino games around - and also super simple to learn! This easy to use, simple Blackjack game will certainly become your new favorite on the web!

Blackjack is a card game that pits player versus dealer. It is played with one or more decks of cards. Cards are counted as their respective numbers, face cards as ten, and ace as either eleven or one (in our game it will show on the counter as an 11 unless you are over 21). The object of Blackjack is the beat the dealer. This can be accomplished by getting Blackjack (first two cards equal 21) without dealer Blackjack, having your final card count be higher than the dealers without exceeding 21, or by not exceeding 21 and dealer busting by exceeding their card count of 21.
